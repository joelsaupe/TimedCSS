			<h1>Test of Day/Night Mode</h1>
			<p>The styling of this page should change within 10 seconds of loading. However, this is just to show the time change. You could set the style sheets to load at a specified time each night so the user would see the night time version after 9pm (or whenever you would like). It will then be disabled after 60 seconds.</p>
